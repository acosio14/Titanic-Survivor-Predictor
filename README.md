# Titanic Survivor Predictor

This was my first AI project. The dataset used is the Titanic survivors dataset from Kaggle. The goal was to train various machine learning models to predict which passengers were most likely to survive the Titanic disaster.

I used multiple models from scikit-learn to compare their performance and determine which achieved the best accuracy. I also trained a PyTorch neural network to compare against the traditional models. The Jupyter notebook, [titanic_notebook](https://github.com/acosio14/Titanic-Survivor-Predictor/blob/main/titanic_notebook.ipynb), walks through my process for training each model and evaluating performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

My results showed that the SVM and the neural network performed the best overall. This was a quick project intended to give me hands-on exposure to the AI workflow, so the results are not meant to be definitive.

Overall, I learned:
- How to use scikit-learn and PyTorch frameworks
- The importance of data cleaning and organization
- How to build a neural network with PyTorch
- How to analyze classification performance metrics

## Models
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Gradient Boosting
- Pytorch Neural Network (Deep Learning)
